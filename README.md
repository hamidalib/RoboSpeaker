# RoboSpeaker

This is my first Python program. Actually, it is my first program that I have ever written that is shareable. I made this after watching a crash course about Python on Youtube. It's very simple but I think as a total begginer who has never written a single line of code, it's great. 

This program runs in IDE like PyCharm. When we run the program, we need to enter some input that our program will say out loud. Is'nt this great. We are calling it RoboSpeaker.
